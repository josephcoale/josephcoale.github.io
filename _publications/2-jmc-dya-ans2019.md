Abstract:<br/>
In this paper, we study a new approach for developing reduced-order models for thermal radiative transfer (TRT) problems defined by the time-dependent multigroup radiative transfer (RT) equations coupled with the material energy balance equation. To reduce dimensionality and formulate reduced-order models (ROMs) for multiphysics problems involving the RT equation, we apply the multilevel nonlinear projective-iterative technique and a hierarchy of low-order quasidiffusion (LOQD) equations (aka Variable Eddington Factor equations). The LOQD equations are defined for the angular and energy moments of the group specific intensity. The multilevel structure of these equations and the way they are coupled enable us to apply them as a basis for developing various ROMs with different degrees of fidelity. It is also possible to formulate flexible ROMs that are capable of resolving accurately physics at different scales of interest. Another component of the proposed ROMs is the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the high-order solution and its moments necessary to generate a database of various parameters of TRT ROMs. Recently this approach was used to develop multigroup ROM based on multilevel LOQD equations with the POD of the group QD (Eddington) factors. This paper presents a grey TRT ROM formulated by means of the grey LOQD equations and POD of group QD factors and group energy densities. We apply this ROM in the case of 1D slab geometry. To analyze the accuracy of the ROM, we use the TRT problem with 17 groups in photon energy based on the Fleck-Cummings test.
