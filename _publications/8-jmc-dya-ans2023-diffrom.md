Abstract:<br/>
In this paper we present a transport-corrected diffusion
(TCD) reduced order model (ROM), developed for the fundamental thermal radiative
transfer (TRT) problem. The TRT problem models a supersonic
flow of photon radiation through matter and serves as
a valuable platform for the development and testing of new
computational methodologies. There exist a group of data-driven
ROMs which have been developed for problems of
linear Boltzmann transport, reactor physics, and
nonlinear radiative transfer. The goal of these
ROMs is to use data-driven approaches to formulate low-cost,
high-fidelity approximations to problems involving Boltzmann
transport. The TCD ROM belongs to the class of data-based
models.
