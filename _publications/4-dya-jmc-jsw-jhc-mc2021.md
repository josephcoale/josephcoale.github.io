Abstract:<br/>
This paper presents multilevel iterative schemes for solving the multigroup Boltzmann transport
equations (BTEs) with parallel calculation of group equations. They are formulated
with multigroup and grey low-order equations of the Second-Moment (SM) method. The
group high-order BTEs and low-order SM (LOSM) equations are solved in parallel. To
further improve convergence and increase computational efficiency of algorithms Anderson
acceleration is applied to inner iterations for solving the system of multigroup LOSM equations.
Numerical results are presented to demonstrate performance of the multilevel iterative
methods.
