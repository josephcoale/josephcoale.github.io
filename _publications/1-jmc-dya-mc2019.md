Abstract:<br/>
Thermal radiative transfer (TRT) is a major piece in various multiphysics phenomena
which are driven by interaction between photons and matter. The dimensionality of TRT
problems is determined by the radiative transfer (RT) equation. In this paper, we study
a new approach for developing physics-based RT reduced-order models. We apply an
efficient method for solving coupled multiphysics equations that enables one to reduce
the dimensionality of the RT problem and combine it with a decomposition-based approach
of reduced order modeling. This paper describes a reduced-order model for TRT
problems formulated by means of the multilevel quasidiffusion (QD) method with proper
orthogonal decomposition of the QD (Eddington) factors that carry essential information
about the RT high-order solution. The numerical results are presented to demonstrate
performance of the proposed method.
