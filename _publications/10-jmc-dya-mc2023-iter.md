Abstract:<br/>
In this paper we present a multilevel projection-based iterative scheme for solving thermal radiative
transfer problems that performs iteration cycles on the high-order Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE) and low-order moment equations. Fully implicit temporal discretization based
on the backward Euler time-integration method is used for all equations. The multilevel iterative
scheme is designed to perform iteration cycles over collections of multiple time steps, each of
which can be interpreted as a coarse time interval with a subgrid of time steps. This treatment is
demonstrated to transform implicit temporal integrators to diagonally-implicit multi-step schemes
on the coarse time grid formed with the amalgamated time intervals. A multilevel set of moment
equations are formulated by the nonlinear projective approach. The Eddington tensor defined
with the BTE solution provides exact closure for the moment equations. During each iteration, a
number of chronological time steps are solved with the BTE alone, afterwhich the same collection
of time steps is solved with the moment equations and material energy balance. Numerical results
are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this iterative scheme for simulating evolving
radiation and heat waves in 2D geometry.
