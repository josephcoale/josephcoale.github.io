Abstract:<br/>
This paper presents a new technique for developing reduced-order models (ROMs) for
nonlinear radiative transfer problems in high-energy density physics. The proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) of photon intensities is applied to obtain global basis functions
for the Galerkin projection (POD-Galerkin) of the time-dependent multigroup Boltzmann
transport equation (BTE) for photons. The POD-Galerkin solution of the BTE is used
to determine the quasidiffusion (Eddington) factors that yield closures for the nonlinear
system of (i) multilevel low-order quasidiffusion (VEF) equations and (ii) material energy
balance equation. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate accuracy of the ROMs
obtained with different low-rank approximations of intensities.
