Abstract:<br/>
Buidling on recent work, a new diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) method for preconditioning the iterative solution of multigroup, discrete-ordinates neutral particle transport calculations is presented. The method decoupled energy groups in the DSA equations, significantly reducing the cost of each diffusion solve compared to traditional DSA when full group-to-group scattering is extant in a problem. Groups are decoupled from one another by reformulating the diffusion equations in such a way that the operator can be diagonalized in energy via an eigendecomposition. This DSA variant is anaylzed with Fourier analysis to demonstrate its theoretical convergence rate.
