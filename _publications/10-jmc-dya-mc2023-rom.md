Abstract:<br/>
In this paper, we present a new data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) for nonlinear thermal
radiative transfer (TRT) problems. The ROM is based on the normalized Boltzmann transport
equation (BTE) and hierarchy of moment equations derived by projection of the BTE over elements
of the phase space. The system of high-order and low-order equations are exactly closed
through the Eddington tensor. Petrov-Galerkin projection is applied to the normalized BTE using
the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to formulate equations for a low-rank expansion of
the Eddington tensor in the phase-space and time. Numerical results of the multigroup Fleck-Cummings
TRT problem in 2D geometry are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this
ROM for the simulation of evolving radiation waves. Results show this model to be accurate with
low-rank expansion of the Eddington tensor based on the POD-Petrov-Galerkin projection of the
normalized BTE.
