Abstract:<br/>
Variations on new and existing diffusion-based synthetic acceleration (DSA) methods for
multigroup SN transport calculations are described and analyzed. The two new methods
that are presented are decoupled in energy and compared to grey DSA (GDSA), and
fully-coupled energy-dependent DSA (FCDSA). While the GDSA involves solving a one-group
diffusion equation, which is relatively computationally inexpensive, it comes at the
cost of reduced acceleration effectiveness compared to the FCDSA method. The new
decoupled methods are going to be much more computationally efficient than solving the
FCDSA equations, particularly if an inner-outer iteration is used to solve the FCDSA
diffusion equations. We compare the effectiveness of the DSA methods using Fourier
analysis and confirm the analysis with numerical measurements. We show that while one
of the new decoupled methods is significantly less effective than FCDSA, but in the other
case it is similar in effectiveness. The latter case is also substantially more effective than
the GDSA method.
